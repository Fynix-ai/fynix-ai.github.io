        <h2>Choose the Right Fynix Copilot Tool for the Job</h2>
        <h3>Code Completions Work Best For:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick inline suggestions as you type, filling in code for repetitive or predictable patterns</li>
            <li>Small, simple functions or code snippets, where the logic is straightforward</li>
            <li>Generating code from natural language comments</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Copilot Chat is Best Suited For:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>More complex questions or discussions where you need detailed explanations or suggestions</li>
            <li>Asking for help on bug fixes, language-specific questions, or guidance on libraries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Create Thoughtful Prompts</h2>
        <p>
            Your interaction with Fynix Copilot is only as good as the prompts you provide. Here are some quick tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be specific about what you want. Instead of asking, “Write a function,” try “Write a Python function that checks if a string is palindrome or not.”</li>
            <li>Provide context for better results. For example, explain the expected input/output or mention any constraints.</li>
            <li>Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts for better code suggestions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Check Copilot's Work</h2>
        <p>
            While Fynix Copilot can provide helpful suggestions, it's essential to review its output for accuracy and security:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the code before implementing: Understand Fynix Copilot’s suggestion, or you can ask it to explain the suggested code.</li>
            <li>Test suggestions: Run tests on the generated code to make sure it behaves as expected.</li>
            <li>Refactor when needed: Fynix Copilot may generate functional code, but it’s still your responsibility to optimize or refactor it for maintainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Guide Copilot Towards Helpful Outputs</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, Fynix Copilot may need a little guidance to produce more valuable suggestions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide helpful context: If Fynix Copilot's suggestion is off-target, refine your prompt with more context or specify the expected output.</li>
            <li>Rewrite prompts: Experiment with phrasing to see if a different approach yields better results.</li>
            <li>Pick the best suggestion: Fynix Copilot often provides multiple suggestions—don’t hesitate to scroll through and pick the one that best suits your needs.</li>
